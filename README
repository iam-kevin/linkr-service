# Linkr

Self-managed / hostable link shortning service

## About

This is a simple, hostable service that provides simple utilities for link redirection.

> This is to help provide the functions needed for my own project, but if it helps the next guy, well nice. Also, trying to not burnout by doing something else

## How it looks like

-   Created by known entities
-   Links are intended for public use
-   Links can expire
-   N/A links go to a 404 page
-   Links can be recycled
-   Links can have a namespace
-   Links should be short
-   Only redirects as GET

## Shortned URL anatomy

The anatomy of the URL to be shortned

```

```

\*Namespaces are optional
